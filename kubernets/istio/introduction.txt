service mesh
==========================
Its requirements can include discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. 

Istio makes it easy to create a network of deployed services with load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, with few or no code changes in service code


**Automatic load balancing for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.

**Fine-grained control of traffic behavior with rich routing rules, retries, failovers, and fault injection.

**A pluggable policy layer and configuration API supporting access controls, rate limits and quotas.

**Automatic metrics, logs, and traces for all traffic within a cluster, including cluster ingress and egress.

**Secure service-to-service communication in a cluster with strong identity-based authentication and authorization.


Traffic Management:	 circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries

security:	security at the application level,manages authentication, authorization, and encryption of service communication at scale. 

Observability:

ipv4 ---> 32 bits[2power32]---> 4 billion Address
ipv6 ---> 64 bits[2power128] ---> 
.co.uk--->.uk top level domain,.co second level domain name

****Top Level doamin are controlled by the InternetAssignedNumberAuthority(IANA)-->www.iana.org/domains/root/db
unique-------->ICANN store in WHOIS Database

StartOfAuthorityRecord(SOA)--->Name of the Server that supplied data for the zone who owns the data

Nameserver---->



ttl --> time to leave (webbroser cache)
=============================================
TimeToLive(Default 48 hrs)---->Length of Dns Record is cached on eitherr Resloving Server or uses local computer  = Time To live in seconds

high 24 hr less traffic on r53
low 60 s more traffic on r53

dig 
============

A Namerecord---> transit the domain to ipAddress
AAAA: url to ipv6
C Namerecord[conanicl Name]---> fb.com.....facebook.com --> non root domain. [free],supports health cheks
Alias Record---> DNS target to other Resource like lB
difference Cname and Alias REcord --> *****cname cannot used for Naked Domain names


cname works for only subdoamins
alias works for main domains also;

An Internet domain name without the "www" or any other subdomains called Naked Domain names. 
For example, computerlanguage.com is a naked domain but www.computerlanguage.com is not, because it contains the www subdomain. 
See Internet domain name and subdomain

Common DNS Typed -->SOA Records,NS records,A Records,CNames,MX Records (Main exchange), PTR Records


Routing Policies
==================
simple Routing   -------->one Record with multible IP adress
Weighted Routing -------->20% traffic to us-east-1 ,80% traffic to us-east-2
Latency-Based-routing---->based lowest latency routes, IndianUser----> R53--------> N.Virgin 
    							    		  									 --------> mumbai        
    							    		  									  which as lowest latency will routes through it 
Health check
==============
after x health check failed --> unhealty ( default: 3)
after x health check passed --> healty ( default: 3)
default health checks intervel : 30s
about 15 health check , check endpoints



FailOver Routing(primary and secondory)	-------------> Cheks health if not health routes to the health(active and passive site) +++++++  r53---> n,virgin failes routes to  the mubai

primary should have health check secondory donot need


GeoLocation routing     -------------> Routing Based on geo graphical location indianUser--->R53--->mumabi
																			UsaUserr--->R53 --->n.virgina


GeoProximity Routing	------------> Traffic flow routing very complicated


MultiVaule Answer routing(advancec to failover)
=================================================
roting traffic to multible resources
r53 health cheks with records
upto 8 healty record for multible query
multible query is not sunstitute to elb

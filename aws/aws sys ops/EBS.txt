EBS : IO, size, Throuput

Network Drive:

4 types:

GPS: Balemces price and performance   --> Boot volume		1 GB-16 TB burst IOPS 3k-16k
		IOPS=3 * size

IO1: High perforce SDD volumes,low latency,high throughput	4 GB-16 TB burst IOPS 16k-32k (64 k nitro)		

ST1: 	low cost HDD volumes frequently acces 
	though put instensive workloads 
	streaming workloads

SC1: less low cost HDD volumes frequently acces 

I/O burst:

burst credit time over time: I/O nedded when reqired --> to 3k ( > 1 TB)

throughput = volume size * IOPs per GB * IOPs per Kb



EBS snapshots: incrementel only change the blocks   ***************region wide not AZ
		max: 1k 

Encrpt unEncrpt volumes: from snapshot copy the snapshot with encrption 

instance store --> good for buffer / cache/ temparaory ( high IOPs)     (only to a few instance types)
		   data lost when reeboot  
 

RAID : 	RAID 0: 
	RAID 1: High Fault Tolerance,
	RAID 3 4 : not recomded by AWS

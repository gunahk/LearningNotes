simple Routing   -------->one Record with multible IP adress
Weighted Routing -------->20% traffic to us-east-1 ,80% traffic to us-east-2
Latency-Based-routing---->based lowest latency routes, IndianUser----> R53--------> N.Virgin 
    							    		   --------> mumbai         which as lowest latency will routes through it 	
FailOver Routing	-------------> Cheks health if not health routes to the health(active and passive site) +++++++  r53---> n,virgin failes routes to  the mubai
GeoLocation routing     -------------> Routing Based on geo graphical location indianUser--->R53--->mumabi
										UsaUserr--->R53 --->n.virgina
GeoProximity Routing	------------> Traffic flow routing very complicated

high avalilibilty


vertical scaling: increse resources of instance

horizonatal scaling: increase No of  instances

Load Balencing: 

  spread load across multible downstream instances
  single point to the application
  handle failure of the downstream instances
  regular health check
  ssl to websites
  stickness with cookies(select LB --> )
  high avalilibilty wih zones
  separate public & private


types: 
  classic:
  application: Layer7 http/https/websockets
  network: Tcp directly see client ip


fix ip to alb --> infront alb put nlb

loadbalence prewarming: 
  sudden increase in  traffic (10x) solution:
    open support ticket with the aws:
      - duration of traffic
      - expected request per sec
      - size of requests

error codes:
  succesfully: 200
  client side error: 


surgequelength: total no of requests or connections that are pending routing to the healty instances(scale out asg)
spiloverquee: no of requests rejected because sergw que is full

    "X-AMzn-Trace-ID": logs for the distributed tracing platform

error :

    Client side error
  5xx:
    503: healty instances in each Azs --> HealtyHostCount in Cloud watch
    504: keep-alive instances enabled, keep-alive is > idel timeout setting in loadbalencer


autoscaling(free but cost for resources)
==================================================================================================================
******autoscaling to cloud watch metrics then rules is defined:
  putmericapi
  react to low/high vavlue
  scaling policy

autoscaling rules:
  network in and out
  cpu(average)
  no of requests per loadbalencer
  schedulecloud watch metrics


healty checks:
  ec2: in no file in ec2 mission still health check is healty in ASG but not in Targer groups
  alb: so it is better to give healty check in alb if instances healty checks fails instances is terminates and creates new instance

AZrebalence: launch new instance then terminates old instance
  suspend launch instance:
    wont lanch instance
    wont terminates instance
  suspend terminates:
    launch the instance
    wont terminate instance

in k8 by default service will send to pods by its ip address 

Ex:	 svc(myssvc)				-->dep(httpd)   
	selecter app: myown			version: newer **
						              app: myown
    				          	-->dep(nginx)	
						          		version: old   **
					               	app: myown

it will load balence between dep both httpd & nginx by there ip address.

we cannot able to send traffic to the only dep(httpd) newer version so we move to istio . 
we can able to route trafic to perticural dep by there lables (version: newer/old)

we define in Destination Rules

---
kind: DestinationRule
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
metadata:
  name: my-svc
  namespace: default
spec:
  host: my-svc   # name of svc that want to route (my-svc)
  subsets:
    - labels:
        version: newer    # name as per tag in deployment
      name: expermental   # name u want to assign to the destination
    - labels:
        version: older  # name as per tag in deployment
      name: original    # name u want to assign to the destination
---

Now if we want to new verion we use name expermental and for old version  use original
we define in VirtualService

---
kind: VirtualService
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
metadata:
  name: my-svc
  namespace: default
spec:
  hosts:      # which incoming host are we applying the proxy rules to???
    - my-svc # service name
    route: # THEN
    - destination:
        host: my-svc
        subset: expermental
        weight: 10
    route:
    - destination:
        host: my-svc
        subset: original
        weight: 90
---
by above VirtualService we can direct traffic 10 % to the expermental and 90 to original

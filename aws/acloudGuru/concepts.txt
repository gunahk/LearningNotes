throughput --> how much data moved at a time-->  heavy load (lorry) 
high IOPS --> how fast read and write -->  high speed (car)

consistency --> ACID,Base

ATOMIC --> transasition all 0r nothing

Consistent --> transasition must be valid

isolated --> transasition cant mess with other 

Durable --> transasition must stick for time

Base

basic avalibility : value avalible
soft state: 
eventual consistence 

persiistence data --> data is stick around reboots, restart
transistence --> stored temp and transfer to other (sns, sqs)
epherameral -->  data is lost when stoped

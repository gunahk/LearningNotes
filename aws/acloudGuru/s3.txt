what to do if billing goes above $10?????
clouldwatch--> crate sns topic ---> to send notification to subscribed user

s3--> simple storage service
================================
************secure,durable highly scable storage
**size --> 0 to 5 TB
**universalName
**s3 url-->

key(nameOfObject),value(SequenceOfBytes),versionId(Versions),MetaData(DataAboutStorage)

dataConsistency(99.99(11 9 s) durability for s3 secure(Access Control list and Bucket policy))
================

******secure(Access Control list and Bucket policy)

Read After Write--> after writing you can able to read
OverRide Puts and Delete(new data is updating) ---> can take some time to propogate

Storage
=========
Tired Storage
Lifecycyle Management
Versioning
Encryption
MFA Delete---> to delete object


s3 -storage Classes(Object level,Bucket Level)
=====================================================
s3-Standerd ----> Default storage
s3-IA(InfrequentAccess) ---> accessed less frquently cost for retrive data
s3 Oneone-IA(RRS{Reduced Redundency}) ---> only access to one rergion(s3-Ia)
s3 Intelligent Tiering -->optimize costs automatically moving data to most cost affective without operation needed
s3 Glacierr --> (min to hours retrive data), Archiev the data cheaper
s3 Glacier Deep -->  (12 hours), Deep Archiv the data much much cheper

Charged
================== 
Storage
Request
StorageMangement
Data Transfer
Transfer Acceleration   (fast,easy,secure over long distances,Uses CloudFront Edge Locations)
Cross region Replication

s3
===
1.NameAndRegion--> name,Region,CopyFromOtherBucket
2.Configure-->Versioning,
3.setPermissions--->BlockPublicAccess
4.review

s3Security
===========
encryption (https/ssl)
1.Encrption At rest(Serrver Side Encyption-SSE-KMS)
2.Encrption At Client(Serrver Side Encyption customer Provided keys-->SSE-C)
3.Aws Key Managed Service (SSE-KMs)

version
===============
versionig--->Cannot be disablead only Suspended
Version MFA Delete Capability 
v1--> make public,Upload V2,v1--> only display,v2 not maken public
delete object ---> older version is present
Integrate LifeCycle Rules

lifeCycleMnagement(BucketNmae--->Mnagement---->LifeCycleRules)
============================

1.NameAndScope--->RuleNAme,TAg
2.Transition---->1.Current Version,2.Previous Version--->transfers to desired (Days After Creation)
3.Expiration---->both Current and Previos --->delete after certen data 

Cross Region(Version enabled) {entire Bucket or Based on Tags Ojects}
===========
****doesnot delete object in replicated regions

BucketName-->Management--->Replication--->AddRule
***Change the storage from the replicated objects
***Change the object ownership to destination bucket name

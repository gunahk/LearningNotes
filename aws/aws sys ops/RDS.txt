Databases(VMS)
===========
ID	f.Name	S.Name	SEx	Age
1	guna	hk	M	27   --> consistency all over database

Tables

2 key features--> 
multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)-->Failover is automatic in multi az (now url is manully have to update)
Read replica(max 5)(regional)(no charge for data)-->(Performance) decrese the heavy load to the primary RDS, (Max 5 read replicas) read replca can have read replica


performance can be increased by read replica and elastic cache


Non Relational
=========================
collection= table
Document = Row
key = value
{
"id":"1"
}

OLTP vs OLAP
===============
OLTP --> online transastion Process --> icci,phonepay,gpay(details os order id)
OLAp --> online Analyitical Process --> (require all computed values at a time of milliean records)
******AWS--Redshift for OLAP



Auror --> serverless + (mysql + postgres) from mysql,postgress can create a auror

backup
===========
automatated(default enabled) -->     at every time max 1 sec 
manully snapshot ---> at the time of you take snapshot 

multi Az --> mysql, nosql, 
read replca --> mysql,postsql, mariadb, oracle, arora
encription at rest -->  mysql,postsql, mariadb, oracle, arora, sql


encription at rest --> make all read replca, snapchat, automated backup will have encription also

only after getting backup(enable)  on only we can get read replica(regions level)


DynamoDB(NO sql) ******(Serverless)
=======
****used for games
stored on SSD 
stored on 3 geographicall area
***********************consistence reads(1 s), strong consistence reads(<1s reads), 


Redshift(Data warehouses) 
==========
differnt architecture---> infrastrrure,database


******single node(168 GB)
******multinode --> leadedr node , computenode(120 nodes),

 
 massive parralel process(MPP):

************retation peroid 1 day (max 35 days)
************maintain 3 copies
************availble in one AZ, snapshot(s3 and sync with s3) and restore in other region


Arora( default and recommended) ******(Serverless)
==========
5* performance , 1/10th of cost with mysql
start 10GB ---> 64 TB (verticall scacling)
cpu   32 GB --> 256 GB meomory
******2 copy of data in each az with mimum 3 AZ
 

elastic cache
============
elastic cache(scale horizontally) --> in memory cache (top 10 products of filpkart)---->1. mem cache 2.reddis


reddis is advanced and have all feauture other than multi tread(mem cache)





databases
============
postgress
oracle
MySql
MariaDb
Oracle
microsoftSql
Auror

read replicas(master and slaves)
===============
5 read replicas
across munti AZ, regions
asyn (eventually consistent [delay some time])
application must update end point of read replicas


multi az(disater recovery)
==========
sync replication
one dns name--> automatic failover
increase availability

backups
=========
automates backups:
	daily full snapshots
	capture transaction logs
	to restore any point
	7 days retention(max 35 days)

DB snapshots:
	manully trigger by user
	rentaINTAION AS much time u want
 
encryption
===========
encrptionn at rest aws kms-aes-256 encruption
ssl( in flight):
	to enforce ssl:
		Postgres:
			rds,force_ssl=1 parameter in aws consloe
		mysql:
			'mysql@%'REQUIRE SSL';
security
=======
iam roles --> mysql/auror

rds vs auror(clod optimazed)
===========
5x permance mysql on mysql
3x permance mysql on postsql
replication is faster has replcas 15
coster 20 % but more efficient
